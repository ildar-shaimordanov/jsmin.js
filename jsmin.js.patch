> This version was patched to keep important comments (denoted with /*!) 
> unchanged. The previous version of jsmin.js ate asterisk symbols and 
> modified some characters as well (for example TAB was replaced by SPACE). 
> Sometimes, comments should stay unchanged (for example, a function could 
> keep its resources within comments). So this version does it.
